"""Creates windowed array from ObsPy Stream or Trace objects

This module offers a function to replace the for loop:
>>> for window in st.slide(window_length, step):
>>>        window...

This for loop is easy and intuitive to use but slow for large dataset

Instead use:
>>> utcdatetime, data_windowed = st2windowed_data(st, window_length, overlap)

utcdatetime contains the UTCDateTime object for each window center
data_windowed is an array with shape: (n_traces, n_windows, window_pts)
